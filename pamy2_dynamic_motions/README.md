# Description
This dataset offers a compilation of long-term dynamic motion data gathered over approximately 3.5 weeks from a novel 4-DoF tendon-driven robotic arm powered by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs).
The data encompasses movements generated by random multisine signals of target pressures, as well as repeated fixed target pressure movements, facilitating the evaluation of system repeatability and performance.

## Converting pressure values to bar

All pressures are represented as integer values.
To convert these values to bar, use the formula
$p_\mathrm{bar} = s\,p_\mathrm{raw} + p_0$ with $s = 0.0002$ and $p_0 = -1.7888$.
